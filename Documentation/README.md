# Documentation

In the following pages you'll find documentation that will help you understand Xcode projects and how to interact with them using xcodeproj.

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): If you are the type of person that likes to get the hands a bit dirty before reading documentation, this is a good place to start from to get a sense of what the interface of the library looks like.
- [Migration guides](migration-guides.md): If you are already using a version of xcodeproj and would like to migrate to the newest version, this document describes the necessary steps that you need to take to migrate between versions.
